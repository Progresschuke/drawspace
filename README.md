# DrawSpace

**DrawSpace** is a canvas drawing app built with **Flutter**, featuring a playful **Rive animated character** on the splash screen. It provides an intuitive drawing experience where users can sketch freely or use predefined shapes — all with responsive support for tablets.

## Features

- **Animated Splash Screen** – Powered by a Rive character that transitions into the drawing page.
- **Drawing Tools** – Choose between freehand drawing, line, or rectangle shapes.
- **Customizable Brushes** – Adjust brush size, stroke width, and pick colors freely.
- **Undo / Redo Support** – Manage your canvas sketches with ease.
- **Eraser Tool** – Erase selected portions of your drawing.
- **Responsive Layout** – Optimized for both phones and tablets.
- **State Management** – Entire app state is handled cleanly with **Riverpod**.

## How It Works

1. Launch the app → Enjoy the **Rive splash animation**.
2. Enter the main drawing page → Select your tool (Freehand, Line, Rectangle, or Eraser).
3. Customize your drawing → Change **color, brush size, or stroke width**.
4. Sketch freely on the canvas → Use **Undo / Redo** to refine your art.
5. Tablet users → Benefit from a **responsive layout** for larger screens.
